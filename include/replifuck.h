 * In fact this is a very special brainfuck:
 *  1) Multithreading: This brainfuck VM is able to execute programs in parallel
 *  2) Von-Neumann model: Code and data is put into same memory
 *  3) Stack: Threads have a stack pointer and data can be pushed ('^') or popped ('V')
 *  3) Memory is simulated to be endless
 *
 * Futher notes:
 *  - Since memory is endless, the command '*' is used as termination command.
 *  - Memory is initialized with random values, not 0
 *
 * TODO: manage threads in a list and supply previous/next
 * TODO: a Gtk GUI with more advanced widgest would be neat (e.g. population graph, signature scanning, 2D memory view)
 * TODO: unused pages should timeout, so that pages can be freed
