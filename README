Replifuck - A brainfuck derivative for self-replicating programs

In fact this is a very special brainfuck:
 1) Multithreading: This brainfuck VM is able to execute programs in parallel
 2) Von-Neumann model: Code and data is put into same memory
 3) Stack: Threads have a stack pointer and data can be pushed ('^') or popped ('V')
 3) Memory is simulated to be endless

Futher notes:
 - Since memory is endless, the command '*' is used as termination command.
 - Memory is initialized with random values, not 0
